# SENG1120 Assignment 1

## Situation

I was required to build the infrastructure to manipulate data related to an eToll operator in Sydney, NSW.
The "client" (course lecturer) has specified that they wanted to have a class named `LinkedList` created to store information about each vehicle that uses its motorway.
The `LinkedList` needed to store the vehicleâ€™s licence number, its type, and the toll charged, in a `Node` of the list, using a provided class `EToll`.
  
## Task

I was tasked to use a Doubly-Linked List to create my own implementation of the `LinkedList` class that will use instances of `Node` to store instances 
of `EToll` using a chained `typedef`.

Both `LinkedList` and `Node` needed to communicate seamlessly with the main program and the class `EToll` provided,
and compile using a Makefile.
